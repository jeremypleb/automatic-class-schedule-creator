Emphasis is placed on crystalline materials, but application to glasses, polymers and other material systems are discussed throughout. Specific topics include: kinetic theory of gases,rate theory, reaction kinetics, irreversible thermodynamics,diffusion in a broad spectrum of material classes (both atomistic mechanisms and phenomenological/continuum level models), influence of defects of diffusion, evolution of surfaces, phase transformations (solidification, nucleation and growth, spinodal decomposition), coarsening, grain growth, and morphological instabilities.  \n","note":null,"offered":null,"prerequisite":null,"recommended":null,"title":"Kinetics of Materials.","credit_hours":"3","lecture_hours":"3","lab_hours":"0","honors_approved":null,"when_taught":"Fall"},"dept_headers":[],"course_headers":[]}
