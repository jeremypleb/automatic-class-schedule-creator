In particular, students will be able to engage with key theoretical issues associated with communication in social media contexts. Further, they will evaluate influential research on creativity, organization, politics, virality, interpersonal communication, identity, representation, and civility, and apply them to online social interaction. The innovative ideas addressed in this seminar will equip media scholars and professionals with the grounding necessary to determine the best practices to use when communicating via emergent media technologies.","note":null,"offered":null,"prerequisite":null,"recommended":null,"title":"Computer-Mediated Communication.","credit_hours":"3","lecture_hours":"3","lab_hours":"0","honors_approved":"N","when_taught":""},"dept_headers":[],"course_headers":[]}
